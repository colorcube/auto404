Introduction
============

What does it do?
----------------

The extension diplays an error page when the requested page couldn't be found.
TYPO3 itself would show a less nice eror message.

There are other extensions with the same (or more) functionality. This one is a bit different:

- no configuration needed
- build in clean error message (as fallback)
- custom error page possible with a normal content page
- will redirect if a page was not deleted but moved to another domain in another page tree
